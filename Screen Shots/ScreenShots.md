# Some intersting screenshots from namesurfer

NameSurfer has some built-in name groups. These can be selected and added to the names that are manually added. Dash has the built-in capability to drill down to a specific name by selecting it from the list of names in the legend. You can also zoom in by selecting an area on the graph.
