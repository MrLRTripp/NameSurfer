# Some intersting screenshots from namesurfer and name_choropleth

NameSurfer has some built-in name groups. These can be selected and added to the names that are manually added. Dash has the built-in capability to drill down to a specific name by selecting it from the list of names in the legend. You can also zoom in by selecting an area on the graph.

The name_choropleth app lets you input a name and then use the slider to select the year to view the choropleth map of the name rank by state. The year slider lets you quickly view the changes over years.
